# Fantasy Football Draft

This script is simple and meant to combine data sources for a fantasy football draft. To start, all I want is to output one CSV that combines data from fantasypros and the_athletic.

## Input Data

There are two datasources

- rankings from fantasypros (need to differentiate between ppr and half_ppr) (https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/half-point-ppr-cheatsheets.php)
- rankings from the_athletic (need to differentiate between different league names bc diff settings)
- ADP from NFFC (https://nfc.shgn.com/adp/football)

## Output

CSV with what you want
